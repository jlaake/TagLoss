  abstract = {Demographic models that use marked animals to estimate survival rates
	and population size assume no tag loss occurs, otherwise estimates
	are biased. Most studies of tag loss have assumed loss of 1 tag was
	independent of loss of the other, as did a prior study of ear tag
	loss in Pennsylvania black bears (Ursus americanus). We used permanently
	marked (tattooed) black bears to model ear tag loss rates so we could
	identify bears recovered missing both ear tags, and thus test the
	independence assumption. We found ear tag loss in male bears increased
	with time between tagging and recovery. Also, for males, the probability
	of losing a second ear tag was greater if it had already lost an
	ear tag. For a tagging-recovery interval of 0.5-<1 year, we estimated
	3\% of males lost both ear tags (95\% CI = 2-4\%); however, for an
	interval of 4.5-<5.5 years, we estimated 56\% lost both ear tags
	(95\% CI = 42-75\%). We selected the same type of model for females,
	but ear tag loss rates were much lower. We estimated 2\% of females
	lost both ear tags for tagging-recovery intervals of 0.5-<1 year
	(95\% CI = 1-4\%), and 5\% of females lost both ear tags for intervals
	of 4-<5 years (95\% CI = 1-18\%). Comparison of survival estimates
	with and without a correction for ear tag loss suggests uncorrected
	annual survival estimates may be biased -6\% for males and -1\% for
	females. Black bears are a long-lived species with high loss rates
	of ear tags for males. Estimates of survival rates or population
	size that use mark-recapture type models should either incorporate
	ear tag loss in the model, especially for males, or use data from
	short time intervals (less than or equal to 1 yr) to minimize bias
	from ear tag loss. In addition to ear tagging to identify individuals
	for mark-recapture studies, we recommend researchers tattoo bears
	on both inner sides of the upper lip.},

	Estimates of annual tag retention rates for lake trout were fairly

	retention rates may be significantly lower in the first year due
	to type I losses. Annual retention rates for some tag types varied

  abstract = {We consider mark-recapture-recovery (MRR) data of animals where the
	model parameters are a function of individual time-varying continuous
	covariates. For such covariates, the covariate value is unobserved
	if the corresponding individual is unobserved, in which case the
	survival probability cannot be evaluated. For continuous-valued covariates,
	the corresponding likelihood can only be expressed in the form of
	an integral that is analytically intractable, and, to date, no maximum
	likelihood approach that uses all the information in the data has
	been developed. Assuming a first-order Markov process for the covariate
	values, we accomplish this task by formulating the MRR setting in
	a state-space framework and considering an approximate likelihood
	approach which essentially discretizes the range of covariate values,
	reducing the integral to a summation. The likelihood can then be
	efficiently calculated and maximized using standard techniques for
	hidden Markov models. We initially assess the approach using simulated
	data before applying to real data relating to Soay sheep, specifying
	the survival probability as a function of body mass. Models that
	have previously been suggested for the corresponding covariate process
	are typically of the form of diffusive random walks. We consider
	an alternative non-diffusive AR(1)-type model which appears to provide
	a significantly better fit to the Soay sheep data.},

	this approach was that the reproductive status of females did not

	of recruitment into the reproductive population began at age 3 or
	4, peaked between ages 5 and 7, and slowly declined. Age-specific

	provides an afternative to using population projection matrices to
	estimate asymptotic lambda and is seeing increased use. However,
	the robustness of direct estimates of lambda(1) to violations of
	several key assumptions has not yet been investigated. Here, we consider
	tag loss as a possible source of bias for scenarios in which the
	rate of tag loss is (1) the same for all marked animals in the population
	and (2) a function of tag age. We computed analytic approximations
	of the expected values for each of the parameter estimators involved
	in direct estimation and used those values to calculate bias and
	precision for each parameter estimator. Estimates of lambda(i) were
	robust to homogeneous rates of tag loss. When tag loss rates varied
	by tag age, bias occurred for some of the sampling situations evaluated,
	especially those with low capture probability, a high rate of tag
	loss, or both. For situations with low rates of tag loss and high
	capture probability, bias was low and often negligible. Estimates
	of contributions of demographic components to lambda(i) were not
	robust to tag loss. Tag loss reduced the precision of all estimates
	because tag loss results in fewer marked animals remaining available
	for estimation. Clearly tag loss should be prevented if possible,
	and should be considered in analyses of lambda(i), but tag loss does
	not necessarily preclude unbiased estimation of lambda(i).},
